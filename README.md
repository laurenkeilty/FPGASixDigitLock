# FPGASixDigitLock

Built for Intel's University Program DE1-S0C FPGA, this project is a six digit lock (passcode 603613) that can be loaded onto the board. When the incorrect combination is entered via the board switches, it displays CLOSED, when the correct combination is entered, it displays OPEN. In depth instructions for the loading and demonstration of the lock are available below.

This project was completed alongside Mudasser Jalal for UBC CPEN 211 Course in Fall 2023. It has since been revised by Lauren Keilty in Summer 2025 for publishing. A summary of contributions is available in the attached Contributions.txt file.
