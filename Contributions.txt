Summer 2025

Lauren:
Removed unnecessary/unused inputs from state machine logic.
Updated to non-blocking assignment in sequential logic to prevent race conditions
Added clarifying comments to state machine, the Switch to HEX connections,
and testbenches.
Added additional scenario to testbenches to capture edge case (Reset hit in the middle of combination entry)


Fall 2023

Lauren:
Wrote the Verilog for generating the Hexes light up values for all possible digits, for errors, and for showing closed and opened (The second always block).


We both created the first test in our pre synthesis and postsynthesis  testbench.
Created the third one in the presythesis and photosynthesis testbench.


Was responsible for more of the generation in modelsim but we worked together to figure it out.
